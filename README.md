# Basics of what I have installed on your computer

## Atom
Atom is a standard text editor and it is what you will use to type your code. You can write in any language in Atom, but you will mainly be editing/making ```.html ``` and ```.css``` with the ocasional ```.js```. What are the different layers here?

### HTML
This is the skeleton of your webpage. This is where you really type your information, add pictures, and format the layout of your website. You can think of HTML as the skeleton of your webpage because it has a navbar (head), then the body of the webpage, then the footer. 

### CSS
This is the style of your website. This is where you can style to ```divs``` and ```containers``` and anything else you want. This is basically adding meat, or style to the webpage. 

### Javascript
Javascript is how you can add dynamic features like fading in, functions for buttons, 
or any other dynammic web movement

## Github
So the Github interface I installed for you is an Graphical User Interface for interfacing with ```git``` version control. Git version control is how you build a project. What is the break down of your project?

### Breakdown
So first to understand you need to know what a Github Repsitory is. So the account I had you make is on Github.com. This is where you can store coding projects and this is also where you are hosting your static page ```sashawooden.github.io```. 

So a repository or ```repo``` is a term for a coding project that you made. The repo name that you are using to edit your website is ```sashawooden.github.io```. So you will be editing this repository which is set up your dektops. 

### Intro to your github terminal
So once you make any number of edits you can then ```commit``` your change and push it live to your master branch. What are branches? What are commits and how are they handeled?

### Branches
You can think of branches as independent copies of your webpage. So the ```master branch``` is what ```Github``` reads from. So only updates to this branch will be updated live. What are the purposes of branches? Branches streamline workflow between multiple people working on the same project. Someone can create a new branch to independetly develop, fix, or add new content on their own version of the website so they can see how it looks (This really only meant for bigger projects for for your purposes you can edit straight to the ```master``` branch.

### Commits
So commits are a bundle of changes you make to a document that you want to make permenant in your current code. (Because git is version control, this can obviously be reversed if needed). So when you are commiting you are adding the memory or instructions of your current changes to a ```stache  memory``` that is stored locally on your computer. Now to make this update live on the websiting you have to ```push to origin aka push```. What is pushing?

### Pushing
Allows you take a bundle of commits and make it permenant in the current branch.

If you have questions, hmu.
